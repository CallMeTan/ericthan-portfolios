## Power BI Visualization and Analytics

Please feel free to take a look at some of the Power BI dashboards I have created by going through the folders below.


## Power BI Visualizations directory
1. ../Visualization_Power_BI/Home_Sales_Analytics/ : visualization report in pdf version and pbix file inside the zip file
   -The folder contains Melbourne Home Property Sales Analytics and Visualizations based on the published Kaggle dataset for "Melbourne Housing Snapshot" by Dans Becker and the dataset is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 which is available for use.
